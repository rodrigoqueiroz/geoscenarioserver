## Running
- run `python3.8 GSServer.py -s scenarios/<geoscenario_file>` to start the Server.
```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s [FILE [FILE ...]], --scenario [FILE [FILE ...]]
                        GeoScenario file. If no file is provided, the GSServer will load a scenario from code
  -q VERBOSE, --quiet VERBOSE
                        don't print messages to stdout
  -m, --map-path 
                        Set the prefix to append to the value of the attribute `globalconfig->lanelet`
                        e.g. --map-path $HOME/anm_unreal_test_suite/maps
  -b, --btree-locations 
                        Add higher priority locations to search for btrees by agent btypes
                        e.g. --btree-locations $HOME/anm_unreal_test_suite/btrees
```

- GeoScenario files (2.0 required) must be placed inside *scenarios/*
- If a file is not given, you must provide a manual problem startup from code.
- LaneletMap files must be placed inside *scenarios/maps* (a map file is mandatory).
- Co-Simulator (Unreal or other) is optional.

## Loading multiple scenario files

- The `--scenario` option can take more than one `.osm` file as its arguments
- For example,
```
python3.8 GSServer.py --scenario scenarios/test_scenarios/gs_straight_obstacles.osm scenarios/test_scenarios/gs_straight_pedestrian.osm
```
- With the exception of `globalconfig` and `origin`, the elements from each scenario are loaded and combined at runtime
- The `globalconfig` and `origin` are used from the first `.osm` file that is specified (which is `gs_straight_obstacles.osm` in the example)
- Multiple scenarios can define vehicles and pedestrians with the same `vid`s and `pid`s
- If these scenarios are passed to the `--scenario` option, then an error will be reported
- All `vid` and `pid` conflicts must be resolved before running `GSServer.py`
- Scenarios can contain vehicles with no `vid` and pedestrians with no `pid`
- These vehicles and pedestrians will be auto-assigned `vid`s and `pid`s
- Auto-assigned `vid`s and `pids` will start from 1 and won't conflict with the other `vid`s and `pid`s

## Configuration:

- Check *SimConfig.py* for configuration options.
- Adjust FRAME_RATE based on hardware performance to avoid drift (Recommended 30Hz).
- Adjust PLANNER_RATE based on hardware performance and what scenario requirements.
- Use SHOW_DASHBOARD = True for GUI. Adjust dashboard refresh rate according to performance.
- Simulations can only run in Real Time (so far).

## Co-Simulation:

- Use the shared memory keys inside SimConfig to read/write the server shared memory blocks.
- We provide a GeoScenario Client for Unreal in */unreal*.
