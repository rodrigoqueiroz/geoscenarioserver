#   GeoScenario Server

Includes: GeoScenario Parser, Checker, Sim Vehicle Planner with Behavior Trees and Maneuver Models.

## Dependencies

- Linux, macOS, or Windows 10/11 + WSL2
- Python >= 3.8

GeoScenario Server can run natively on Linux, within a [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) environment, or on WSL2.

### Deb packages for Linux native

Tested on native Ubuntu 20.04, 22.04, 24.04, and within Windows 10 WSL2.

- python3
- python3-dev
- python3-tk
- python3-pip
- python3-pil
- python3-pil.imagetk

### Python packages

- antlr4-python3-runtime==4.9.3 (later versions cause a parsing error `Exception: Could not deserialize ATN with version (expected 4).`)
- antlr-denter
- glog
- lanelet2
- matplotlib
- numpy
- scipy
- [py_trees==0.7.6](https://github.com/splintered-reality/py_trees)
- sysv-ipc
- tk

To automatically install the dependencies for linux native, execute

```
bash scripts/install_dependencies.bash
```

Alternatively, to automatically create a conda-forge environment called `gss` with the required packages, execute
```
bash scripts/setup_conda-forge_env.bash
```

## Running

- run `python3 GSServer.py -s scenarios/<geoscenario_file>` to start the Server.

```
optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -s [FILE [FILE ...]], --scenario [FILE [FILE ...]]
                        GeoScenario file. If no file is provided, the GSServer will load a scenario from code
  -q VERBOSE, --quiet VERBOSE
                        don't print messages to stdout
  -m, --map-path
                        Set the prefix to append to the value of the attribute `globalconfig->lanelet`
                        e.g. --map-path $HOME/wise-sim-test-suite/maps
  -b, --btree-locations
                        Add higher priority locations to search for btrees by agent btypes
                        e.g. --btree-locations $HOME/wise-sim-test-suite/btrees
  --verify_map          Lanelet map file
```

- GeoScenario files (2.0 required) must be placed inside *scenarios/*
- If a file is not given, you must provide a manual problem startup from code.
- LaneletMap files must be placed inside *scenarios/maps* (a map file is mandatory).
- Co-Simulator ([WISE Sim](https://uwaterloo.ca/waterloo-intelligent-systems-engineering-lab/projects/wise-sim),  [Carla](https://carla.org/), or other) is optional.

## Loading multiple scenario files

- The `--scenario` option can take more than one `.osm` file as its arguments
- For example,
```
python3 GSServer.py --scenario scenarios/test_scenarios/gs_straight_obstacles.osm scenarios/test_scenarios/gs_straight_pedestrian.osm
```
- With the exception of `globalconfig` and `origin`, the elements from each scenario are loaded and combined at runtime
- The `globalconfig` and `origin` are used from the first `.osm` file that is specified (which is `gs_straight_obstacles.osm` in the example)
- Multiple scenarios can define vehicles and pedestrians with the same `vid`s and `pid`s
- If these scenarios are passed to the `--scenario` option, then an error will be reported
- All `vid` and `pid` conflicts must be resolved before running `GSServer.py`
- Scenarios can contain vehicles with no `vid` and pedestrians with no `pid`
- These vehicles and pedestrians will be auto-assigned `vid`s and `pid`s
- Auto-assigned `vid`s and `pids` will start from 1 and won't conflict with the other `vid`s and `pid`s

## Configuration:

- Check *SimConfig.py* for configuration options.
- Adjust FRAME_RATE based on hardware performance to avoid drift (Recommended 30Hz).
- Adjust PLANNER_RATE based on hardware performance and what scenario requirements.
- Use SHOW_DASHBOARD = True for GUI. Adjust dashboard refresh rate according to performance.
- Simulations can only run in Real Time (so far).

## Co-Simulation:

- Use the shared memory keys inside SimConfig to read/write the server shared memory blocks.
- We provide a GeoScenario Client for Unreal in */unreal*.

## Documentation:

# Using a .devcontainer

GeoScenario server can be used and developed on Linux, Windows, and MacOS with Visual Studio Code and Docker via the Dev Container.

## Setting up Docker and Visual Studio Code

1. Install Docker Desktop for your operating system from https://docs.docker.com/desktop/
  - on Windows, ensure that you have Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) version 2 enabled:
    1. enable WSL in "Turn Windows features on and off" (alternatively, in elevated cmd execute `dism.exe /online /enable-feature /featurename:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux /all /norestart`),
    2. execute `wsl --set-default-version 2` in cmd
2. Install Visual Studio Code
  - Install the `Dev Containers` VS Code extension

1. Clone the repository and open in VS Code
  - on Windows, prevent `git` from switching line endings back and forth: execute `git config --global core.autocrlf false` before cloning
2. Click on "Reopen in Container" button as shown in the screenshot below (alternatively, execute the command "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container" from command palette):
![Reopen in Container dialog](.devcontainer/reopen-in-container.png)
3. After the docker image is built and the dev container is started, open a new terminal ("Terminal: Create New Terminal" from command palette) and execute `./GSServer.py --help`.
